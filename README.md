# Project1

In the education industry, I am going to use the following datasets to understand the connection between stress, education quality, and socio-economic status. The stress data set is a collection of self reported questions about the stress felt by HS students in the United States. The good education dataset is whether high schoolers feel they are getting a good education. Finally, the socio economic data includes percentages of poverty levels by state.

All of our data was obtained from data.world.
