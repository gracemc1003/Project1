# Project 1: Jimmy Wrangler, Data Explorer

In the education industry, I am going to use the following datasets to understand the connection between stress, education quality, and socio-economic status. The stress data set is a collection of self reported questions about the stress felt by HS students in the United States. The good education dataset is whether high schoolers feel they are getting a good education. Finally, the socio economic data includes percentages of poverty levels by state.

All of our data was obtained from data.world.

The purpose of this project is to obtain data and combine the datafiles to a single set so that we can answer the following questions.

## Questions

Part of this project was to identify questions that could be answered by combining 2-3 public datasets. With the above dataset we could investigate:
* Do states with a higher level of their population living in poverty have a higher percentage of high school students that are always stressed?
* Do states with a higher peace index rating have a lower percentage of high school students that are always stressed?
* Do states who have a highest percentage of their population that have obtained Bachelor's degrees have a higher percentage of high school students that feel like they are recieiving a good education?
* Is there a correlation between the socio-economic status of a state and the percentage of high school students that are stressed about college?
